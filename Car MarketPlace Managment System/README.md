# Car Market Management Project

## Overview

Over the weekend task (September 28-30, 2023), we asked to take data and cuilt function on the primary file, "carMarket," which contains details about car sales agencies. This information includes the agency names, available funds, and the inventory of cars, specifying the car type and price. The data is structured within objects, incorporating an array of objects.

In addition to sellers, the dataset also includes information about buyers. Through the implementation of diverse functions, I executed different actions for both sellers and buyers. For instance, I developed a function facilitating the transfer of a car from one dealership to another. Furthermore, I created a function to identify the most expensive and cheapest cars available for sale.

Undertaking this exercise proved to be quite challenging, contributing significantly to my deeper understanding of the material.
